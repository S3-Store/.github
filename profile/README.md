> [!Caution]  
> The [S3-Store Project](https://github.com/orgs/S3-Store/projects/1) is work in progress and is not yet production ready.

The **S3_STORE** is a modern eCommerce System built for today's requirements.
It aims to be a **S**imple, **S**olid **S**tore ready for production environments providing reasonable defaults ready for use.
Our Company **GMS** needed a new platform for our activities and we weren't bought in on going cloud with our customer data. 
For this reason and many others we created **S3**, a production ready fork of Solidus.

S3 is a fork of [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus).
We would like to personally dedicate this website to Blish, Nebulab and Super Good, three companies without Solidus and therefor also S3 wouldn't exist. 

We aim to make S3: 
- EU Ready by providing the logic for Privacy, B2B and B2C taxation and collect all data for einvoicing;
- have a starter template ready for operation including Google Analytics and Structured Data;
- Provide a stock integration to ERPNext.

The current progress can be found in the [S3_Store project](https://github.com/orgs/S3-Store/projects/1).
